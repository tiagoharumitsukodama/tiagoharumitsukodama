### I am a physicist, studying actuarial science and improving myself as a fullstack developer and this is my portfolio! ðŸš€

I have worked as a C++ programmer, researcher and teacher. Although my main base is in education, I don't limit myself by following a linear course. My goal is to solve challenges and be able to be myself in a plural team.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently participating in the Fullstack bootcamp with Labenu.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to work with a communicative team.
- ðŸ’¬ I can aggregate with creative solutions in both backend and frontend.
